Hello world ! My name is Milan George and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am familiar with Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React and R. Wish to collaborate on a fun, exciting project ? We can discuss over a cup of Java :) (pun intended) .
